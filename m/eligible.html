                            <b>Introduction</b><br><br>
                            You are invited to take part in a survey for people with insomnia or poor sleep. In this
                            study, we aim to determine the digital health preferences and user experience needs in
                            relation to a new mobile application to improve sleep.<br><br>
                            You have been invited to participate in this study because you have insomnia or have poor
                            sleep. This Participant Information Statement (PIS) tells you about the research study.
                            Knowing what is involved will help you decide if you want to take part in the research.
                            Please read this carefully and ask questions about anything that you don’t understand or
                            want to know more about.<br><br>
                            Participation in this research is voluntary. If you do not wish to take part, you do not
                            have to and without consequence. If you decide you want to take part in the research study
                            and continue to the survey, it is assumed you consent to the details in this
                            document.<br><br>
                            <b>What is the purpose of this research?</b><br><br>
                            The purpose of this research is to determine the digital behaviours and User Experience (UX)
                            needs for a mobile sleep app in older adults from the community aged 60 years or over.
                            SleepFix is one such app that has been developed as a digital tool by the Woolcock Institute
                            to deliver digital brief behavioural therapy for insomnia (dBBTi) in adults. However, this
                            app has not yet been tested in or optimised for an older population. This survey will be
                            completed online and distributed nation-wide. It will be a key resource in optimising the
                            SleepFix app for the successful treatment of insomnia and poor sleep within this
                            population.<br><br>
                            The study is sponsored by the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, supported by a grant
                            from the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Alertness Safety and Productivity.<br><br>
                            <b>Who can take part in the study?</b><br><br>
                            You can complete the survey if you have insomnia, poor sleep and if you are aged 60 or
                            over.<br><br>
                            <b>What does participation in this research involve?</b><br><br>
                            This study is entirely online and anonymous. If you agree to participate, you are simply
                            required to fill out the online questionnaires through the secure online platform
                            (www.sleepsurvey.com.au). You will first be asked to complete two short questionnaires
                            assessing insomnia symptoms and poor sleep (5 minutes). If eligible, you will then be asked
                            to read this participant information sheet and give your consent by digitally ticking the “I
                            consent to taking part in the study” checkbox. This will allow you to progress to the online
                            survey (10-15 minutes). The survey consists of 22 questions about your phone usage,
                            preferences relating to sleep mobile application features and previous experiences with
                            health mobile applications. The questions will be a mix of multi-part questions, Likert-type
                            scale questions, yes-no and ‘select all that apply’ questions as well as some open-ended
                            questions. Absolutely no identifiable data will be collected.<br><br>
                            <b>Can I withdraw from the study once I've started?</b><br><br>
                            Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You do not have to take part in it. Your
                            decision whether to participate will not affect your current or future relationship with the
                            researchers or anyone else at The University of Sydney or Woolcock Institute of Medical
                            Research.<br><br>
                            Submitting your completed questionnaire is an indication of your consent to participate in
                            the study. You can withdraw your responses any time before you have submitted the
                            questionnaire. Once you have submitted it, your responses cannot be withdrawn because they
                            are anonymous and therefore we will not be able to tell what data is yours.<br><br>
                            <b>What are the side-effects and/or risks associated with this study?</b><br><br>
                            Aside from giving up your time, we do not expect that there will be any risks or costs
                            associated with taking part in this study.<br><br>
                            <b>What are the benefits associated with being in the study?</b><br><br>
                            It is hoped that by taking part in this research, you will be providing valuable information
                            regarding sleep health app usage and behaviours of older adults who are poor sleepers. This
                            may aid in the development of a mobile application that may be effective at treating poor
                            sleep in this population.<br><br>
                            We are also offering participants who complete the survey, the opportunity to take part in a
                            prize draw for 1 of 3 eGift Cards valued at $200 each.<br><br>
                            If you wish to take part in the prize draw, you will need to provide a mobile number
                            following completion of the survey (on the last page). Your mobile number will then go into
                            a draw with the other participants who completed the survey. When the survey completion time
                            closes, a random draw of supplied mobile numbers will be undertaken by a researcher who is
                            not involved in the study. The successful participant will be notified by a telephone call
                            to the mobile number. Please note, participation in the prize draw is voluntary.<br><br>
                            <b>How do I access the results of the study?</b><br><br>
                            You have a right to receive feedback about the overall results of this study. You can tell
                            us that you wish to receive feedback by providing your contact details in the survey. This
                            feedback will be in the form of a summary of the project’s findings. You will receive this
                            feedback after the study is finished.<br><br>
                            <b>What will happen to the data I enter?</b><br><br>
                            All information obtained during this study is anonymous as we collect no personal
                            identification. By providing consent, you are agreeing to these conditions and understand
                            that any data published in scientific journals will not identify you.<br><br>
                            All questionnaire and survey data will be captured on an encrypted web-based database
                            connected through the backend of the public-facing study website (www.sleepsurvey.com.au)
                            via a securely encrypted link. The database is stored securely using password protection
                            that only authorised research members have access to.<br><br>
                            Any contact details you enter for either the prize draw, or to receive study outcome
                            information will be collated in a separate file on the database that will not be attached to
                            your survey responses. These files will be permanently deleted once their purpose has been
                            fulfilled.<br><br>
