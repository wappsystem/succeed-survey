                            program that can be accessed via a website or iOS app and aims to help improve your insomnia
                            symptoms using digital Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). In this study, we
                            would like to find out if digital CBT-I improves insomnia symptoms as well as cognitive
                            performance.</h3>
                        <h3>This is a 12-week study for individuals who are over the age of 50, have sleep and cognitive
                            problems and access to a smartphone or computer. </h3>
